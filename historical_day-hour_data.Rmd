This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
BreadBasket_DMS.csv
df <- read.csv("./dataset/BreadBasket_DMS.csv")
head(df)
```


```{r}
api_key <- "your_key_here"
date <- seq(as.Date("2017-06-01"), as.Date("2017-07-31"), by = 1)
pws <- "KILCHICA403"

Weather <- vector("list", length = length(date))

for(i in seq_along(Weather)){
  url <- paste0("http://api.wunderground.com/api/", api_key,
                "/history_", format(date[i], format = "%Y%m%d"), "/q/pws:",
                pws, ".json")
  result <- rjson::fromJSON(paste0(readLines(url), collapse = " "))
  Weather[[i]] <- do.call("rbind", lapply(result[[2]][[3]], as.data.frame, 
                                          stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
  Sys.sleep(6)
}

Weather <- do.call("rbind", Weather)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
